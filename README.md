# Stackoverflow Project

## Introduction
Stack overflow is a professional community for developers. They conduct developer surveys every year since 2011. The collected data is available open-source on the web. The Dataset would help us to answer real-world questions with the help of proper analysis. The most popular language that developers use can be found through the analysis. We also can find the developer role which pays the highest salary. The aim of our project is to analyze the 2022 developer surveys datasets from where we collect valuable insights from them.

## Methodology
This analysis is going to follow the CRISP-DM methodology, cross-industry process for data mining. CRISP-DM is a robust and well known methodology that provides a structured approach to planning a data mining project. It includes the following processes:

1. Business understanding
2. Data understanding
3. Preparing data
4. Data modeling
5. Evaluating results

In this project, the survey results will be used to answer the following questions for aspiring data scientists:

1. What are the most working programming language in 2022? 
2. what are the top jobs in 2022?
3. What is the proportion of developers who work remotely?
4. What are the most learning course certification in 2022?
